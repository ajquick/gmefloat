# GMEFloat.com

This site is a copy of https://gmefloor.com with minor tweaks to count the number of shares locked in the GameStop float at the transfer agent, Computershare.

The data relies upon GameStop's 10Q Earnings report released on December 8, 2021 which has 5.2 million as a starting point. The second data points come from Computershared.net and the DRS bot on Reddit. It is estimated that the current locked up float is around 14 million on December 9, 2021 with 33 million shares in the total free trading float, excluding insiders, instutitions and mutual funds.

All credit goes to GMEFloor.com, [Computershared.net](http://computershared.net) and the DRS bot.

# Updates

December 29, 2021: The number is approximately 18M and has diverged from Computershared.net and the DRSBot by a considerable amount. While DRSBot is currently showing around 16M, Computershared is estimating between 7M-15M. Other estimates put the actual number around 10M. I am adjusting the formula to set the current rate to around 14M.
